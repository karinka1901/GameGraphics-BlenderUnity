This is a school assigment for Basics of Game Graphics course. The main task was to create a small, realistic 3D environment in Unity using PBR workflows and custom assets modeled in Blender.

Assignment Summary:
- Modeled 3D assets in Blender: chair, barrel, candle, and table.
- Imported assets into Unity and applied PBR materials.
- Created and assigned Albedo, Normal, and other texture maps to simulate realistic surfaces.
